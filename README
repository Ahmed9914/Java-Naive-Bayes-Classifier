Naive Bayes Classifier implemented in Java.

Nothing special, but it works.

Performance improvements, I am currently thinking of:

- For each feature store the total number of occurrences instead of iterating over all available categories trying to find an occurrence.
- Store the natural logarithms of the feature probabilities and add them together instead of multiplying the probability numbers
