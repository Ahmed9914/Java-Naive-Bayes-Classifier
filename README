Naive Bayes Classifier implemented in Java.

Nothing special, but it works.

Performance improvements, I am currently thinking of:

- For each feature store the total number of occurrences instead of iterating over all available categories trying to find an occurrence.
- Store the natural logarithms of the feature probabilities and add them together instead of multiplying the probability numbers

Use the ClassifierTester to test. Here is an Example:

> train dogs I like
> train cats I hate
> classify What do I like
dogs
> classify What do I hate
cats

The classifier will forget classifications after - defaulting to 1000 - classifications learned.
This will ensure, that the classifier can react to ongoing changes in the user's habbits.
